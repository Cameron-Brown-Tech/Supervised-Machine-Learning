# Supervised-Machine-Learning
Basic Supervised Machine Learning model of a Dataset based on STEM Salaries

This script was made as part of an assingment in my masters course. It utilises Logistic Regression and a 30:70 test split.

The data I picked was not suitable for ML, to rectify this some mapping was done to encode into numbers.
